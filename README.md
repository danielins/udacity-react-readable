Second project made for the Udacity React Development Nanodegree, featuring Redux.

### Installation of the API server

To run this project correctly you'll need to have the API server installed. The server repository can be [found here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter)

After you download the repository, go to its location on the console prompt and install its dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

After that, you can start the local server with:

```sh
$ node server
```

You should be able to access the API guide on your browser via `localhost:5001`. With the local server working properly, you can head to the actual application in this repository.


### Installation the Application

To install the project locally on your machine, lead your another console prompt to the folder where the repository was cloned or downloaded. Then use this command:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Make sure to have npm installed on your machine.

### Running

To run the project you'll have to start the local development serve. On the same path you used the install command, now use:

```sh
$ npm start
```

When the server is succesfully started, your default browser should open with the app already running. If it doesn't or if you want to open it on another tab or browser, access via `localhost:3000`. Be sure that the API server is still running.



To stop both the server and the application, `CTRL+C` keyboard command on their respective prompts.
